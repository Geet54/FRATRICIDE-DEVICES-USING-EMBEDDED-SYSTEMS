# FRATRICIDE-DEVICES-USING-EMBEDDED-SYSTEMS
An intelligent low-power embedded system to avoid friendly fire incidents using RF & IR-based communication for enhanced battlefield coordination and safety.

🧠 Overview
Friendly fire (Fratricide) remains a serious concern in modern military operations. This project provides an embedded solution leveraging RF communication and IR sensors to identify allies and prevent unintended attacks on friendly forces.

🔍 Key Features
📡 Real-time RF Communication (nRF24L01)

👁‍🗨 IR-Based Line-of-Sight Detection

📍 Proximity-based Threat Alerts

🔔 Alarms: Sound | LED | Vibration

⚙ Modular, Scalable & Energy Efficient

🧠 Microcontroller Integrated

🧰 Tech Stack
- Microcontroller: Arduino (or any suitable MCU)
- Wireless Module: nRF24L01
- Sensors: IR Proximity Sensors
- Programming: Embedded C/C++
- Power Supply: Rechargeable Battery Pack

🛡 Use Case
- Military squads operating in low-visibility zones.
- Situations where soldier and vehicle identification is critical.
- Autonomous or semi-autonomous combat robotics.

🚀 How it Works
- Each unit broadcasts a unique RF signature.
- IR sensors detect line-of-sight proximity.
- If friendly units enter a weapon’s line of fire, the system triggers alerts.
- Signals (sound, light, or vibration) prevent accidental engagement.
